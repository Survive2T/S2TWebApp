        <p>
          Survive 2 Thrive is a 3d platformer with a real-time physics
          simulation handling liquids, solids, and gases. Players can collect
          resources, construct bases, automate systems, and explore a
          procedurally generated map.

        <h2>Story</h2>
        <p>
          In a post-apocalyptic world, you awake inside of a dark bunker. The
          bunker has kept you safe for many months, however, rations are running
          low and systems are failing. Exploration of once familiar world
          remains your only chance for survival. In this new environment you
          will be tested and constantly reminded of how close to death you truly
          are.

        <h2>Hardcore Survival Experience</h2>
        <p>
          Beware this game will test you! It will push you to the brink of death
          and if you somehow survive, this world will find a new way to kill
          you. You start with a limited supply of food, water, and oxygen. You
          will need to build, automate, and explore if you are to have any hope
          of surviving. Seriously though, this game is made by lunatic and you
          will die.

      <div class="Build">
        <img src="images/img-build.png" alt="" />
        <h2>Build System</h2>
        <p>
          You will need to build everything... and I mean everything from power,
          plumbing, air/water purification, storage, food, defense systems. Did
          I mention this world wants to kill you? How you choose to greet death
          is your choice.

      <div class="Physics">

        <h2>Particle Based Physics System</h2>
        <p>
          Elements will be able to change states and flow just like they would
          in real life. So yes that means we will have solids, liquids, gases
          running on a particle based physics simulation. I am not saying you
          should go to college as a physics major before playing this game, but
          hey, it might help. Some people call this the dark souls of survival
          games... you should probably just move on.

        <h2>3d Platformer</h2>
        <p>
          The game is built in 3d world which you will be able to see through a
          2d third person view... Gamers who play platformers like super meat
          boy, terraria, or hallow knight will feel at home navigating this
          world.
